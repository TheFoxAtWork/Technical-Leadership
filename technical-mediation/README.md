# Technical Mediation

Technical Mediation is the process by which an individual can elevate or address differences of opinion. It is a structured approach to identifying concerns, exploring their facets, and balancing the concern with supportive information, outliers, and risk. Technical mediation should always include recommendations alongside the concern to provide for a progressive and collaborative conversation.

## Effectively conveying technical concerns

You may be on the receiving end or the source of an identified technical concern. Some of these concerns may appear to be significant and aren't or genuinely are. The following sections describe how to break down a concern to ensure due diligence occurs in identifying its importance, the context surrounding it, risks, and really just figuring out if it's valid. This could be leveraged when performing technical mediation between aggrieved engineers who have conflicting perspectives on what is most critical (or should be prioritized).

First - write out the raw concern. Have it in front of you, it doesn't need to be polished, it can have improper grammar, terms like “ARGH” to express core areas of frustration, etc.

Next, break up the concern into complete or near-complete thoughts. Put some line breaks in. You’ll be addressing each of them.

Next create the following structure above where you have the concern captured. The visual aid in moving the raw concern further and further below the clean, well-constructed concern as you write it demonstrates cognitive progress in conveyance.

* Problem Statement
  * Exacerbations
* Recommendation
  * Outliers to the recommendation
  * Risks

The problem statement is likely to be two to four sentences of content. Work through each complete or near-complete thought and develop it. Your first sentence is the main point of the issue. Additional sentences should not provide modifiers to the first sentence, rather they are a brief background to support the first sentence and make it stronger. 

Exacerbations are explanations of the size or complexity of the issue. They must convey the impact – in detail – if the concern were to go unaddressed. You will likely be making assumptions here, or extrapolating on limited evidence. If you have hard data that clearly articulates the concern on its own and you aren’t being heard, you have a very different problem.
Go back to those complete or near-complete thoughts, have you captured everything?

The recommendation is critical. No one gets to [swoop and poop](https://kanopi.com/blog/how-to-avoid-the-swoop-and-poop/) unless they are well positioned to do so and if this was the case you wouldn’t be conveying technical concerns - you’d be directing work. Your recommendation must provide a balanced and reasonable solution that weighs the tradeoffs. It needs to be thoughtful, deliberate, and actionable.
Go back to your problem statement and exacerbations, did you address all of it? If you did fantastic. In all likelihood there are probably some outliers you need to cover that your recommendation definitely won’t. Think of them as the “leftover gotchas”. 

Outliers to the recommendation are the leftover gotchas that any person reading your recommendation is likely to throw back at you to find flaws in the recommendation. Showcasing that you’ve already thought about them, and maybe leave it slightly open for rumination ensures your reader is placed in a collaborative position. You’ve provided more than the olive branch, you’ve given them the space to be heard and shown your willingness to give them the time and courtesy to be heard.

Risks are just that, what are the risks of completing the recommendation? What are you likely to encounter? This is effectively your time to tell your reader what could go wrong so they can either brace for impact and not be surprised or at the very least explain why the risks are simply unacceptable (which is totally okay).

Go back to your raw concern - if you feel like you’ve got it all, then you're golden, if not and you’re stuck, invite a colleague in to assist in breaking it down.

### Reviewing Technical work with critical feedback

Depending on your role, you may be required to review the technical written work of another engineer or non-engineer. In some cases the work is well written, articulate, and clear requiring very little feedback from you beyond asking pointed questions where considerations may not have been fully explored. In other cases there are large holes in logic, unwritten assumptions, missing references, and you will feel like you can’t possibly provide enough critique. 

It can be frustrating, in some cases exacerbating. What is important is that you recognize this individual spent time in creating the work for you to look at and will be in a defensive position with whatever feedback you provide. Such is the nature of creativity and implicit pride in accomplishing something because they are not only intellectually but emotionally engaged in the outcome. You’ve empowered them to do the work, now coach them to do it better.

Some considerations when providing your review:
* Make your initial impressions in a separate document or area. This is for your eyes only.
* Ask the author how they would like feedback, sometimes individuals want suggestions and comment on the content, sometimes they want it integrated - your goal is to understand how your can structure your feedback in a way that allows them to be open to receiving it
* Any feedback you wrote out, ask yourself
  * Is this feedback specific and actionable?
  * Am I giving them the answers or am I guiding them on how to find it?
    *This one is tricky - usually you want to guide them on how to find answers, however if it's urgent, you may just need to give them the answers
  * Am I asking them to make a change without providing an example of what I’m looking for?
  * Out of context, does this feedback make sense?
  * Have I provided some background, perspective, clear reasoning with the feedback?
* Now consider whether some of your feedback is a matter of preference
  * Preferences can be structured with writing, style guides, or design pattern, if one exists kindly point to it with the specific example of where to find the answer in the guide. Or suggest the change yourself and cite why (i.e., added the Intended Audience to ensure readers know who we’re addressing in accordance with our guide located here)
 * If you don’t have a writing, style guide, or design pattern - propose one after the work is final. Nothing is more frustrating than moving the finish line when they are nearly there.
* Rewrite your feedback
  * Use an online inclusivity tool to understand the sentiment you are conveying
  * Ask a colleague to review your feedback, is it harsh? Are there cultural of social differences you haven't considered that would change how your feedback is delivered or written?
* Ask for feedback on your feedback!
  * Be upfront, let them know you are trying to improve how you provide feedback to others. Do they feel they can take it as is? Did it make sense? Was there a better way you could have conveyed it?

## Addressing Technical Concerns

You may be put in a position where someone repeatedly asks you questions that seem confrontational and you feel like you need to defend your idea, project, or effort. 
It has been my experience that repeat questions occur for one of two reasons (the reasons actually don't impact the needed outcome)
* the individual is presented with a project area that needs input, they genuinely are trying to make sense of the complexity in the ask, to verify its doing what is desired. Having a comprehensive understanding allows them to engage meaningfully.
* the individual is being purposefully disruptive and not attempting to move towards resolution.
Often the context or line of questions will give you insight into which it is, a lot of the time it's going to be the former. This is especially hard to tell in written form and communication exchanges such as comments in docs or slack messages. Audible tone and body language are usually excellent resources to understand which it is and both are very absent in asynchronous communication which means you will spend more cognitive capital in addressing those concerns. If you find it is the latter, that is a very different conversation of a behavioral nature which is not addressed in this document.

Those questions are being asked for a reason- they don't have the answer and you are the individual likely to be able to answer them. If someone is asking, that is a good indicator there will be others asking too. So being able to answer the “why” is important, especially if it's missing from whatever material you have made available (in whole or in part). It is often an insignificant amount of effort to add this and to proactively prevent additional questions and back and forth. You already have the information in your head, write it down, make it clear. You may challenge your own assumptions in the process for the benefit of clarity in the project you’re working on.

### Explaining things

Perhaps the best expression of what makes a good explanation is that which is reflected in [Prioritizing vulnerability response: A stakeholder-specific vulnerability categorization (version 2.0)](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/WhitePaper/2021_019_001_653461.pdf). I’ve summarized the content below in a way that is applicable to most technical mediation events.

Explanations should make the content and topic intelligible to an _interested, competent, **non-expert** person_. This means it must provide enough information that it lays out assumptions, could be independently validated or troubleshot, and provides room for error correction. Depending on the context of where the explanation is warranted, it may also be capable of justifying a decision based on its contents.

Effectively, any explanation should have:
* an “if” - any assumptions or prior knowledge we assume to be present
* a “then” - content that is logic-based, independently verifiable, or conveys a process by which the audience can follow along 
* an “else” - defines exceptions to the explanation, caveats, or safeguards for error correction

### Cognitive Capital Expenses

Technical mediation is not without some trade off. To be clear- it’s the correct thing to do, but you should know what to expect and be able to attribute how you feel after to what’s causing it.

You see, you are experiencing two opposing forces.  The need and desire to build something awesome.  That awesomeness requires explanation, reasoning, and justification to others for pursuit to be successful. You are responsible for bringing others alongside you to get their buy-in.

The first is fun (do the awesome thing). The second - not so much (get buy-in and persuade/convince others).

This is the exchange in technical leadership and addressing technical concerns, you need to bring others into your mindset that allows them to arrive at the same outcome you have. Show them how to untie the knots, not do it for them. It takes more cognitive load and is a mental muscle that needs exercised for it to work well.

The funny thing with mental exercise is that doing it a lot doesn't make you great immediately (weight lifting increases strength and you feel the burn). In mental exercise, you can only reach the point of pre-burn and then pull back/ tap out for a break. The muscle works differently. The next time you reach pre-burn, it will be a bit more exercise and time to get there than the last time. 

The other aspect of this is that you are working across your communication style, and whenever you do that it doubles the cognitive load. It's like putting a very direct, focused, quick response leader that is data driven and a quiet-but-social, not-detail oriented engineer in the same room. This is not a recipe for success, the leader has to spend more cognitive capital engaging in the social aspects of discussion to bring the engineer to their level of conversation and the engineer has to spend more cognitive capital engaging in the detail oriented aspects of the discussion to bring the leader to their level of conversation.

Do this repeatedly for more than two hours in a given day and you feel exhausted and irritable - it's because you spent all your cognitive capital and your battery is drained.

You need to own and identify when you are approaching “low funds” and “low battery”. Leverage your team and support system to tap out. Let them know you need some time to recharge your brain and will be stepping away from communication mediums for a bit to do so. 

Another way to proactively manage this is to pre-block one hour every 2-3 hours. That’s your recovery time. Do something mechanical, something that is second nature and requires very little ambiguous, critical, or exploratory thinking. It could be programming, troubleshooting a problem, or even reading that newsletter you’ve been putting off.
